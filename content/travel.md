London is also served by [Eurostar](http://www.eurostar.com), providing rail links with continental Europe via the Channel Tunnel and terminating in Central London. 

## Getting around in London

[Transport for London (TfL)](https://www.tfl.gov.uk) operates public transport in London. You can travel with an [Oyster card](https://tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/oyster) or your [contactless payment card](https://tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/contactless). TfL also issues [paper tickets](https://tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/ways-to-pay/paper-tickets).

We strongly suggest you either obtain an Oyster Card at the earliest opportunity when you arrive in London, or alternatively use a contactless payment card. You can obtain an Oyster Card at any London Underground station, which requires payment of a refundable deposit. You can alternatively arrange for a [Visitor Oyster Card](https://tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/visiting-london/visitor-oyster-card) to be shipped to your address in advance of the event. If you want to use your contactless payment card, we advise you to [check](https://tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/contactless/what-are-contactless-payment-cards) which cards are accepted on TfL before travelling.

## Visa Information

Information about obtaining a visa for those traveling to the United Kingdom are available on the website https://www.gov.uk/apply-uk-visa. International registrants should be particularly aware and careful about visa requirements, and should plan travel well in advance.

Please note that the Association for Computing Machinery does not issue formal invitation letters for visas to attend ACM sponsored conferences. However a visa support letter can be issued upon request.

### Requesting Visa Support Letters
As part of the visa application process, you may be required to provide a visa support letter. ACM is able to provide visa support letters to attendees as well as authors with accepted papers, posters, or members of the conference committee.

To request a visa support letter, register for the conference and then email your request to [supportletters@acm.org](mailto:supportletters@acm.org). The request should include the following information:

1. Your name as it appears on your passport
1. Your current postal mailing address
1. The name of the conference you wish to attend (“ACM IMC 2017”)
1. Your Registration Confirmation Number
1. If you have any papers accepted for the conference, please provide the title and indicate whether you are the "sole author" or a "co-author"
1. A fax number or email address of where the letter can be sent

Visa support letter requests are handled in the order they are received. You should allow 7-10 business days to receive it.

Please note that support letters will only be sent to participants who have registered and paid for the conference. Should participants withdraw from the conference after the issuance of a support letter, the consulate will be notified of the withdrawal accordingly.

If you have any questions about the visa support letter process, feel free to contact ACM IMC 2017 registration chair [Matthias Wählisch](mailto:m.waehlisch@fu-berlin.de).
