# Camera-Ready Instructions

**September 29, 2017** is camera-ready due for all accepted papers (full and short). In essence, you need to do the following:

1. Address all reviewer comments, revise your paper, and get approval from your shepherd.
1. Fill out copyright form.
1. Adapt your stylesheet to the most recent ACM template, include bibliographic and copyright strip.
1. Upload the camera-ready version, including source files of the paper text and auxiliary material, to HotCRP.

## A note on auxiliary material

ACM IMC 2017 promotes reproducible research and highly encourages you to submit auxiliary material. ACM calls extra files which are not reviewed as part of the submitted paper but which an author supplies as an additional resource for the reader “Auxiliary Materials” (e.g., data set or source code of programs). **ACM will not take copyright** to Auxiliary Material which is not reviewed and is not part of the formally published work. But ACM still needs permission from the owner to serve Auxiliary Materials and an agreement that the author is abiding by ACM terms when supplying the non-reviewed Auxiliary Material. Checking Part II of the form and saying YES to the terms grants ACM permission to serve the Auxiliary Materials.

Auxiliary material should not exceed 100MB. If your data is larger, please put an example and a link to the full dataset.

Note that IMC 2017 does not take supplements, as those require explicit review.

## Revise the paper

* You must revise the original submission to address the reviewers’ concerns.
* Obtain an explicit approval of the final version from the shepherd.
* We highly encourage you to use auxiliary material (see above).

## Complete rights management form

* Before submitting camera-ready papers, you need to complete the rights management form. You will be notified by email once these forms are available and ready to sign. 
* As rights management emails are sent from an automated system, there is a chance that emails sent will wind up in SPAM folders. Please make sure that you and your authors set email SPAM settings to allow emails from "rightsreview@acm.org".

## Format paper

* **Full papers** should be no more than 13 pages single-spaced pages for text and figures+ unlimited pages for references. 
* **Short papers** should be no more than 6 single-spaced pages for text and figures + unlimited pages for references. 
* ACM templates can be found here: http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template. In TeX, you should use **`\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}`**.
* Note that the originally submitted paper used the old ACM template. The font size in the submission template was 10pt, the new template will use 9pt. Using the new ACM template means that you have more space, to address the comments by the reviewers.
* Please do NOT number the pages of your camera-ready paper (by default page numbers are disabled in the ACM template).
* You should provide proper indexing information in the final version according to the ACM Computing Classification System (CCS). More information about the ACM CCS is available on [ACM CCS website](https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012).
* After completing their rights management form, you will be emailed the correct rights management text and bibliographic strip to place within your paper. It is essential that you add the text into your paper. Make use of the following TeX macros:
  * `\acmYear{2017}`
  * `\copyrightyear{2017}`
  * `\setcopyright{acmcopyright}`
  * `\acmConference{IMC '17}{November 1--3, 2017}{London, UK}`
  * `\acmPrice{TBA}`
  * `\acmDOI{TBA}`
  * `\acmISBN{TBA}`
* Inclusion of running headers is a requirement. Please shorten the headers if title or list of authors is too long, such as:
  * `\title[Short title]{Looooong title}`
  * `\renewcommand{\shortauthors}{First author et al.}`
* Avoid using any special characters or non-standard fonts. We must be able to display and print your submission exactly as we receive it using only standard tools and printers, so we strongly suggest that you use only standard fonts embedded in the PDF file.

## Submit camera-ready version
* Go to the ACM IMC 2017 submission page and edit your paper: https://imc17.hotcrp.com.
* Submit the source files and PDF of your camera-ready paper. 
* Submit auxiliary material.
