# Call For Posters, ACM IMC 2017, London, UK

The [2017 Internet Measurement Conference](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2017) will include a poster session. The poster session is an opportunity for researchers to discuss their early/ongoing work, tools, and datasets to attendees of IMC. The poster session is not a publication venue, but a forum for the exchange of ideas with peers from the community.

Topics of interest include [all topics listed on the general IMC 2017 call-for-papers](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2017/cfp), but as a poster session, we look for *early work* of interest to the community, even if it is not yet complete, and for *tools or datasets that are of use to the community*, even if the tool or dataset by itself may not warrant a full paper.

The poster session chairs are [Chadi Barakat](https://team.inria.fr/diana/team-members/chadi/) and [David Choffnes](http://david.choffnes.com/); please [contact them](mailto:chadi.barakat@inria.fr,choffnes@ccs.neu.edu) for questions.

## Review process, criteria and submissions guidelines

We expect to take as many posters as we can support at the venue, with the goal of sharing early results rather than providing final work. Submissions should not be previously published in a workshop, conference, or journal. Previously presented poster and demo ideas are ok, as are descriptions of previously published tools/datasets that have new features.

We expect to lightly review submissions for appropriateness, and we may prioritize for time. The hard deadline for poster submission is September 15th, 2017 AOE. Notification will be one week later. 

The submission format is text-only abstracts, along with a title, author names and affiliations. You are limited to 500 words, and we will not accept or review any PDFs.

The submission site is [here](https://imc17-poster.ccs.neu.edu/). There is limited space for posters, so please submit early to guarantee your slot -- if we receive too many submissions we will prioritize in order of (initial) submission time.

## Ethical Considerations

Posters have the same ethical considerations as general IMC talks (as described in the [general IMC 2017 call-for-papers](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2017/cfp)).
